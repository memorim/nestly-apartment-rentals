## Implemented

- District/room/price filters and listing detail pages.
- Persisted enquiries validated against available listings.

## Stack and architecture

JavaScript, Express, Zod, built-in Node SQLite and a static HTML/CSS interface.

## Technical mechanisms and security

- Queries bind user values rather than interpolate them into SQL. Listing availability is checked before saving an enquiry.
- Default loopback binding and bounded JSON errors match the current local trust model.

## Local setup

Node.js 24.18.0 and pnpm 11.7.0 (see version files).

```bash
npm install --global pnpm@11.7.0
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm start
```

Open `http://localhost:4600`. For live UI development use `pnpm dev` where available. The API binds to `127.0.0.1` by default.

## Configuration

Configure process environment variables using [.env.example](.env.example). `pnpm start` uses the process environment; it does not implicitly load that file. To load a copied `.env` explicitly, run `node --env-file=.env server.js`.

## Database and upgrades

SQLite is stored at `data/nestly.db`. Initialization creates/migrates the schema; sample rows are included for local use. Back up the database before upgrades. Do not remove the database as a migration step.

## Verification

```bash
pnpm test
pnpm test:contract
pnpm test:upgrade
pnpm audit --audit-level=high
```

Existing catalogue/enquiry tests, malformed-JSON regression, response contract and prior-schema upgrade checks.

CI installs locked dependencies and runs the configured checks; documentation checks also validate local links/images. Python dependency auditing uses `pip-audit --disable-pip --no-deps --strict -r requirements-lock.txt`. A passing scanner only reports known advisories at the time of the run.

## Limits and next steps

- No verified user accounts, payment, live map, availability calendar or connected CRM.
- Input lengths/query ranges and spam protection should be tightened before operating a public lead form.
